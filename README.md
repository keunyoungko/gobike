# Era of Ford GoBike
A web app that investigates the efficiency of San Francisco's then-bike share system GoBike during its implementation, from June 2017 to June 2019.

## Description
The public bike sharing system Ford GoBike was implemented in the city of San Francisco from June 2017 to June 2019, before Lyft launched its brand of Bay Wheels and replaced it.

In order to study its efficiency and its users, I designed an interactive density map to classify popular locations based on start and end stations, and create an animated graph to study monthly demographic trends of subscribers and customers. 

## Data
The data were retrieved via Lyft official website. The points shown in the second graph were randomly selected (200 out of thousands of available points) in order to stay under the app size limit of 1 GB.
